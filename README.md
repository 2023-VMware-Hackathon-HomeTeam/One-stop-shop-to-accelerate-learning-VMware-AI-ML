# One-stop-shop-to-accelerate-learning-VMware-AI-ML
One stop shop to accelerate your learning of VMware and AI/ML

## Introduction
This document is our product for the 2023 VMware Explore Hackathon. We wanted to create a resource that can help a Virtual Infrastructure Admin understand the current landscape of AI/ML and how they can learn more about it, while also including how to learn these technologies from the comfort of your home. We also want to explore how much you can use your homelab to help you learn VMware technology in this field, and if we can make it easier for you, we will!

The Home Team - One stop shop to accelerate your learning of VMware and AI/ML:  
- Learn new technologies in the AI/ML space with your homelab.
- Automate a test environment and research CPU/GPU/etc capabilities.

## What is AI/ML


## Where can you learn it?

### Free

### Paid

## What would you need to run AI/ML or even Large Language Models in your homelab, test lab at work, etc?

### GPU

Probably the best resource for everything NVIDIA plus vSphere is this link https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment-guide-vmware/0.1.0/index.html

### CPU, RAM, Storage
