# One-stop-shop-to-accelerate-learning-VMware-AI-ML
One stop shop to accelerate your learning of VMware and AI/ML

## Introduction
This document is our product for the 2023 VMware Explore Hackathon. We wanted to create a resource that can help a Virtual Infrastructure Admin understand the current landscape of AI/ML and how they can learn more about it, while also including how to learn these technologies from the comfort of your home. We also want to explore how much you can use your homelab to help you learn VMware technology in this field, and if we can make it easier for you, we will!

The Home Team - One stop shop to accelerate your learning of VMware and AI/ML:  
- Learn new technologies in the AI/ML space with your homelab.
- Automate a test environment and research CPU/GPU/etc capabilities.

## What is AI/ML

_Artificial Intelligence (AI)_ refers to intelligent systems that can perform human-like tasks. Tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding language. AI uses algorithms and processes data to do this. These systems can be narrow or general in scope. Narrow AI focuses on specific tasks, like image recognition or natural language processing. General AI aims to replicate human-like intelligence across a range of activities.

_Machine Learning (ML)_ is a subset of AI. ML empowers computers to learn and improve through experience instead of explicit programming. These systems use large datasets to train models, and identify patterns and relationships. This enables the system to make decisions or predictions without human help.

There are different types of ML, each catering to specific tasks and goals:

- supervised learning,
- unsupervised learning, and
- reinforcement learning.

_Supervised learning_ involves training the system with labeled data. _Unsupervised learning_ deals with unlabeled data to find patterns and groupings. _Reinforcement learning_ focuses on training the system through trial and error. Rewarding successful actions and penalizing unsuccessful ones.

For VI Admins, AI and ML open up many possibilities, such as:

- Optimizing complex processes,
- Automating routine tasks, and
- Improving data analytics.

## Where and how can you learn it?

### Free

### Paid

## What would you need to run AI/ML or even Large Language Models in your homelab, test lab at work, etc?

### GPU

#### Nvidia

Probably the best resource for everything NVIDIA plus vSphere is this link https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment-guide-vmware/0.1.0/index.html

### CPU, RAM, Storage


## Quickstart guide for a homelab (any caveats?) but still have fun
